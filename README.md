## Introduction

This repository contains the code of Official Website for **Underdogs Crew**, which is a **dance group** of **Amity University Lucknow**. 

We participate as a group as well as individuals in various dance competitions in and around Lucknow with a group of versatile dancers and new sets of choreographies.

## Setup - to run the Underdogs website

2) Open a browser of your choice (we recommend [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/))
3) In your browser, click ```File + Open File```, at the top, and open index.html in your **UNDERDOGS-V2** folder (if using Mac, the keyboard shortcut is Command + O)
